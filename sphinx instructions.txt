Copy the source folder and generate.bat file into a docs folder in your main project/library folder

Edit the generate.bat file to make sure it points to your chosen interpreter

Run the generate.bat file

Run the sphinx rst automator 

Add new rst file names to index.rst's toc tree

Make sure any changes are made to include information to your specific project in the build html files(may need to delete build folder and re-run generate.bat)

Add :obj: to any data types for args or returns throughout all files in the project.

Check formatting is correct in the web page

Go through and update information to your specific project in the conf.py files, rst files.

Common Errors
-------------

Import module issue  - code # : 3221225477
	If sphinx can't seem to find a module, this issue may be fixed by 
	adding the module's name to the autodoc_mock_imports list at the bottom of conf.py

Make sure to use `, not ' on data types within doc strings
example:
	:obj:`str` instead of :obj:'str',  or  :obj:`str'

Make sure to not use indents after 'returns' for multiline portions in doc strings, follow this example for 
correct formatting in sphinx doc page:

Correct:
Returns:
	(:obj:`list`): Values of the target timestep. If vector, list of lists where each inner list contains an x and y
	component value.
		
Incorrect:
