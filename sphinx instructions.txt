Getting Started
---------------

First, copy the source folder and generate.bat file into a docs folder in 
your main project/library folder

Next, edit the generate.bat file to make sure it points to your chosen interpreter



Run the generate.bat file

Make sure any changes are made to include information to your specific project in the build html files

Place folder and file names into a text file - see automation_source_example.txt

Run the sphinx autodoc text automator 

Copy and paste the .rst files from the output folder into the doc/source folder in your project. 

Make sure to add those file names to index.rst's toc tree

Make sure to make a few key stroke changes and save the rst files to make sure they get refreshed. 
	This can even be just a press of the enter button.
	
Add :obj: to any data types for args or returns throughout all files in the project.

Check formatting is correct in the web page

Go through and update information to your specific project in the conf.py files, rst files. 

Finalize any changes needed and add information as desired

Common Errors
-------------

Import module issue  - code # : 3221225477
	If sphinx can't seem to find a module, this issue may be fixed by 
	adding the module's name to the autodoc_mock_imports list at the bottom of conf.py

Make sure to use `, not ' on data types within doc strings
example:
	:obj:`str` instead of :obj:'str',  or  :obj:`str'

Make sure to not use indents after 'returns' for multiline portions in doc strings, follow this example for 
correct formatting in sphinx doc page:

Correct:
Returns:
	(:obj:`list`): Values of the target timestep. If vector, list of lists where each inner list contains an x and y
	component value.
		
Incorrect:
Returns:
	(:obj:`list`): Values of the target timestep. If vector, list of lists where each inner list contains an x and y
		component value.
